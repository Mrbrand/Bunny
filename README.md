Task manager with HTML, JS and local storage

##Why make another task app?
Well, I have tested a whole lot of task manager apps throughout the years. 
But none of them completely satisfies my requirements. 
* Tree structured tasks
* Task prio
* Task types
* Task size
* Preview subtasks
* Filter by prio
* Filter by type
