Task manager with phonegap

##Why make another task app?
Well, I have tested a whole lot of task manager apps throughout the years. 
But none of them completely satisfies my requirements. 
* Tree structured tasks
* Task prio
* Task types
* Task size
* Preview subtasks
* Filter by prio
* Filter by type

##Background
As the description says, the app is built with Phonegap. To be honest i tried to install phonegap and cordova but failed miserably due to my lack of knowledge. 
Then i got a tip from a friend: http://build.phonegap.com  
This terrific page does all the work for me. It just pulls the code from github and gives me the compiled .apk file. Brilliant!
